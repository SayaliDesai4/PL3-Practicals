                <h2>Civil Engineering</h2>
                <p>Civil engineering is the oldest of the main disciplines of engineering. Civil engineering, the mother branch, has kept pace with the rapid growth in the field of technology. It is that branch of engineering which provides basic amenities required for the survival and maintenance of the environment. These civil engineers built all types of structures, design water-supply, sewer systems, railroads, highways and plan cities.

                    The department of civil engineering established in 1947, with capacity of 60 for under-graduate courses. At present department runs two Post Graduate programmes namely Structural Engineering (intake 24) and Construction and Management (intake 18). The Civil Engineering department has 14 well established laboratories equipped with all necessary instruments/equipment and all facilities required for providing quality education to the students and also to offer consultancy services to various private as well as government organizations.</p>
                    <br><h2>Vision</h2>
                    <p>To be an outstanding department devoted to provide high end research and technical education in Civil engineering which will produce socially aware professionals to provide solutions to global community.</p>
